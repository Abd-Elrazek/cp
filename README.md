# cp (Competitive Programming)
A repository to backup my competitive programming source code since 2013. What is Competitive Programming? You can read here. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming"Competitive Programming")

This repo contains source code of solutions for problems from online judges: Codeforces, TopCoder, CodeChef, HackerRank, TLX, SPOJ. Also it contains my solutions for problemset from some competitions, both online and onsite.

Since August 2016, problems are classified by the directory, based on the event/contest or the online judges. I decide to make the repo filesystem simple (tree with 1-depth), so there will be many of directories. Past solutions are located at `0-unclassified` directory.

You can freely use this repository for whatever: learn about competitive programming, or just want to know how I solved CP problem.

I maintain this repository myself. If there any inquiries, you can contact me here: l.arifin.siswanto@gmail.com

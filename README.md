# cp
A repository to backup my competitive programming source code since 2013.

These file are solutions of problem from various online judge, mostly for Codeforces, TopCoder, CodeChef, and TokiLearning.org

All file mostly named by the last name of the problem, if tied then by the first name of problem, if tied then second, third, etc.

Example : 

Problem name  : Berland and Cities

Source code   : cities.cpp or berland.cpp or and.cpp

Since 2016, I started to classify problems by their contest. Problem from different contest will be located on different directory.

/*

It was me who cried
Not showing your weakness doesn’t mean that you’re strong
Because you told me. I believe

My breath becomes cold and my foot stretches in front of me back home
I might even forget the warmness that I felt just now
I just realized how it feels to love someone

It was me who cried
The beautiful winter constellations, hope they don’t disappear from the skies
I looked at it, I believe

I want to protect this hand so that it will never separate
What I want to say doesn’t come as words
Laughing at things surrounding you softly

Counting the number of shooting stars
I’m here right now because we met
Because you taught me, I believe

It was me who cried
Not showing your weakness doesn’t mean that you’re strong
Because you told me. I believe

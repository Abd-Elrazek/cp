  COMPETITION
  Is the time you kill. The ill you will create.
  The knowledge you neglect to learn.
  The connection you fail to build.
  the health you sacrifice along the path.
  Your inability to generate ideas.
  The people around you who dont support and love.
  Your effort and whatever god you curse for badluck.
